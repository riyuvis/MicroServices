# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the DevSecOps AWS flow with Bedrock integration.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth
The security architecture implements multiple layers of protection:

1. **Network Security**
   - VPC with private and public subnets
   - Security groups with least privilege access
   - Network ACLs for additional protection
   - WAF for application-level protection

2. **Identity and Access Management**
   - IAM roles and policies with least privilege
   - Service accounts for Kubernetes
   - Multi-factor authentication for admin access
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Application Security**
   - Container security scanning
   - Static and dynamic code analysis
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Runtime security monitoring

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
   - Database encryption
   - Backup encryption

## AWS Bedrock Security Integration

### AI-Powered Security Scanning
The system uses AWS Bedrock with Claude 3 Sonnet for:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
  - Code vulnerability detection
  - Security pattern recognition
  - Compliance checking
  - Best practice validation

- **Infrastructure Security Analysis**
  - Terraform configuration analysis
  - Kubernetes manifest security review
  - Cloud resource security assessment
  - Misconfiguration detection

### Security Scanning Features

#### Code Analysis
```javascript
// Example security analysis with Bedrock
const analysis = await bedrockService.analyzeCodeSecurity(code, 'javascript', {
  includeCompliance: true,
  checkOWASPTop10: true,
  analyzeDependencies: true
});
```

#### Infrastructure Analysis
```javascript
// Example infrastructure security analysis
const infraAnalysis = await bedrockService.analyzeInfrastructureSecurity(
  terraformConfig, 
  'terraform'
);
```

## Security Controls

### Authentication and Authorization

#### JWT Token Security
- Secure token generation with strong secrets
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token revocation capabilities

#### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Container Security

#### Image Security
- Base image scanning for vulnerabilities
- Minimal attack surface with distroless images
- Regular image updates
- Image signing and verification

#### Runtime Security
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only root filesystem
- Security contexts and capabilities
- Resource limits and quotas

### Network Security

#### VPC Configuration
```hcl
# Secure VPC configuration
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true
  
  tags = {
    Name = "devsecops-vpc"
  }
}
```

#### Security Groups
```hcl
# Restrictive security group
resource "aws_security_group" "api" {
  name_prefix = "api-"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [aws_vpc.main.cidr_block]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

## Compliance and Standards

### Supported Compliance Frameworks

#### SOC 2 Type II

### Compliance Monitoring

#### AWS Config Rules
```yaml
# Example Config rule for compliance
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: compliance-rules
data:
  s3-bucket-encryption: |
    - name: s3-bucket-encryption
      source: AWS::S3::Bucket
      compliance: REQUIRED
      rule: server-side-encryption-enabled
```

#### Security Hub Integration
- Centralized security findings
- Automated compliance checks
- Custom insights and dashboards
- Integration with third-party tools

## Security Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring

#### Security Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API access patterns
- Container security violations
- Network intrusion attempts

#### Alerting Rules
```yaml
# Example security alert
- alert: SecurityScanFailure
  expr: increase(security_scan_failures_total[1h]) > 0
  for: 0m
  labels:
    severity: critical
    service: security
  annotations:
    summary: "Security scan failed"
    description: "Security scan has failed {{ $value }} times in the last hour"
```
