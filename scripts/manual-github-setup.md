# 🔧 Manual GitHub Repository Setup

Since the GitHub CLI needs a terminal restart, here's how to set up your GitHub repository manually:

## **Step 1: Restart Terminal**

**Please close and reopen your terminal/PowerShell window**, then come back to run the setup script.

## **Step 2: Alternative - Manual Setup**

If you prefer to set up manually, follow these steps:

### **A. Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)**

```bash
# Check if you're in a git repository
git status

# If not, initialize git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
```

### **B. Set Up GitHub Secrets Manually**

Go to your GitHub repository:
1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add these secrets one by one:

#### **Required Secrets:**
```
Name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
Value: your_aws_access_key_id

Name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  
Value: your_aws_secret_access_key

Name: BEDROCK_AGENT_ID
Value: your_bedrock_agent_id

Name: BEDROCK_AGENT_ALIAS_ID
Value: TSTALIASID (or your specific alias)

Name: ECR_REGISTRY
Value: your_account.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

#### **Optional Secrets:**
```
Name: SECURITY_TEAM_EMAIL
Value: security@yourcompany.com

Name: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
Value: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...

Name: GRAFANA_URL
Value: https://grafana.yourdomain.com

Name: GRAFANA_API_KEY
Value: your_grafana_api_key

Name: SNYK_TOKEN
Value: your_snyk_token
```

### **C. Commit and Push Pipeline**

```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add AI-powered DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline configuration

- GitHub Actions workflow for automated security analysis
- Bedrock Agent integration for AI-powered vulnerability detection  
- Security gate checks with configurable thresholds
- Automated deployment pipeline with Terraform and Kubernetes
- Monitoring and reporting with Grafana dashboards
- Email and Slack notifications for security alerts

Powered by AWS Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## **Step 3: Verify Setup**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click the "Actions" tab**
3. **Look for "🛡️ Bedrock AI Security Analysis Pipeline"**
4. **Make a test commit to trigger the pipeline**

## **Step 4: Test the Pipeline**

```bash
# Make a small test change
echo "# Test: CI/CD Pipeline Integration" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test: Trigger CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

## **What You'll Get:**

✅ **Automated Security Analysis** on every push/PR
✅ **AI-Powered Vulnerability Detection** using Bedrock Agent
✅ **Security Gate Protection** preventing vulnerable deployments
✅ **Automated Deployment** with Terraform and Kubernetes
✅ **Real-time Monitoring** with Grafana dashboards
✅ **Smart Notifications** via email/Slack

## **Pipeline Triggers:**

- **Push to main/develop** → Full analysis + deployment
- **Pull Request** → Security analysis + PR comments
- **Daily Schedule** → Full scan + security summary

## **Security Gate Thresholds:**

- **Critical Issues**: 0 (blocks deployment)
- **High Issues**: 3 (warns, allows deployment)
- **Medium Issues**: 10 (monitors)
- **Low Issues**: 50 (tracks)

## **Next Steps After Setup:**

1. ✅ **Monitor GitHub Actions** for pipeline runs
2. ✅ **Review security reports** generated by Bedrock Agent
3. ✅ **Customize thresholds** based on your project needs
4. ✅ **Set up notifications** for your team
5. ✅ **Train team** on new security workflow

**Your AI-powered DevSecOps pipeline will now automatically analyze every code change for security vulnerabilities!** 🛡️
